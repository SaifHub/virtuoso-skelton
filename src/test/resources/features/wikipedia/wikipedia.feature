Feature: Wikipedia searching
  As a user
  I want to use Wikipedia
  So that I find information on topics of interest

  Scenario Outline: Wikipedia search
    Given the Wikipedia site is accessed
    When I search for lists '<Item>'
    Then I check results

  Examples:
  | Item      	   |
  | Computing 	   |
  | Apple          |
